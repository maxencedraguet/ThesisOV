How does \gls{dips} work under the hood? The interpretability of machine learning models is an active area of research. Several effective approaches exist to gauge the importance of the input on the prediction. Figure~\ref{fig:dipsSaliency} presents the result of applying the \textit{saliency maps} technique \cite{Simonyan2013DeepIC}. Using the $b$-tagging discriminant $D_b$ of Equation \ref{bdisc} at a fixed efficiency of 77\%, the average importance of each feature in the track inputs is assessed by averaging the gradient of the discriminant with respect to the track features over a set of $N$ jets with strictly 8 associated tracks failing the threshold:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial D_b}{\partial x_{ik}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{\partial D_b^{j}}{\partial x_{ik}^{j}},
\end{equation} 
where $i$ indexes the 8 tracks, $j$ indexes the jet in the sample of size $N$, $x_{ik}$ is the $k^{th}$ feature of the $i^{th}$ track \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2020-014}. This process effectively probes the linear sensitivity of the discriminant on the track features. Using the saliency map, one can infer what features to modify to correct the failed tag assigned to the $b$-jets sample. The most sensitive parameters are measured to be the \gls{ip} significances of the first five tracks, and the logarithm of the $p_T^{\textrm{frac}}$ and $\Delta R$ of the track with largest $|s_{d_0}|$. This observation is physically motivated by the dynamic of the harder fragmentation of $b$-quarks, compared to light- and $c$-quarks. Negative gradients are measured for shared and split hits observables, translating into a further incorrect discriminant under a linear increase of these features. This is also physically motivated, as higher counts can be traced back to denser event environments where random combinations of hits to form tracks are more likely. However, total hit counts in the different tracker layers have a small positive impact, as these correlate with the reconstruction of the \gls{ip} parameters.

\section{GN2 public plots}
A comparison of the global performance of this \gls{gn2} model to the \gls{dl1d} and \gls{gn1} models is displayed in the $b$- and $c$-tagging \gls{roc} curves of Figures \ref{fig:GN2rocb} and \ref{fig:GN2rocc}. These results are taken from Ref \cite{ATL-PLOT-FTAG-2023-01}, for which the \gls{dl1d} model was retrained on the same dataset as \gls{gn2}, and the \gls{dl1r} and \gls{gn1} models are taken from Chapter \ref{chap-GN1}. \gls{gn2} delivers yet another significant boost to performance, drasticaly surpassing the \gls{gn1} rejections at all efficiencies considered. The largest improvement is again obtained at lower $b$-jet efficiencies. Compared to \gls{gn1}, \gls{gn2} delivers $\times 1.5$ ($\times 1.7$) the $c$-rejection (light-rejection) on $t\bar{t}$ at the 70\% $b$-tagging \gls{wp} and $\times 1.75$ ($\times 1.2$) on $Z'$ at 30\% \gls{wp}. With respect to \gls{dl1d}, the gains in $c$-rejection (light-rejection) are respectively close to $\times 3$ ($\times 2$) for $t\bar{t}$ and $\times 3.4$ ($\times 4$) on $Z'$. Concerning $c$-tagging, a similar large performance gained is obtained by the new \gls{gnn} family over \gls{dl1d}, although the change on the $t\bar{t}$ is more impressive for the $b$-jet ratio than for light-jet. This indicates a non-optimal choice for the flavour fraction $f^c_b$, which was set at 0.2 for all models.

\section{GN2 supporting plots}\label{app-GN2sup}
This section presents more plots in support of Chapter \ref{chap-GN2}. Figure \ref{apfig:GNxptc_eff} presents the $c$-tagging efficiency per bin for an overall $c$-tagging working point of 30\% per region displayed. Figure \ref{apfig:GNxptc_efffixedl} presents the $c$-tagging efficiency per bin for a per bin light-rejection of 50 for $t\bar{t}$ and 10 for $Z'$. The \gls{gn2} performance dominates across the board, except for the highest energy bin of the $Z'$. Figures \ref{apfig:GNxptc_efffixedl} presents the $c$- and light-rejection at an inclusive 70\% $b$-tagging \gls{wp}. The equivalent information for $c$-tagging at a $c$-tagging \gls{wp} of 30\% is displayed in Figures \ref{apfig:GNxptc_brej} and \ref{apfig:GNxptc_urej} for $b$- and light-rejection.
